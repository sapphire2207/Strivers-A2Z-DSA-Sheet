// KMP Algorithm or LPS Array

// Problem Statement: Given two strings, one is a text string and the other is a pattern string. Find and print the indices of all the occurrences of the pattern string within the text string. Use 0-based indexing for the indices, and ensure that the indices are in ascending order. If the pattern does not occur in the text, return an empty list.
// Implement this solution using the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm for efficient pattern matching.
// Examples
// Input: text = "abracadabra", pattern = "abra"
// Output: [0, 7]
// Explanation:  The pattern "abra" appears at the 0st and 7th positions in the text "abracadabra".

// Input: text = "abcabcabc", pattern = "abc"
// Output: [0, 3, 6]
// Explanation: The pattern "abc" appears at the 0st, 3th, and 6th positions in the text "abcabcabc".

// KMP Algorithm
// Why do we use KMP Algorithm (LPS Array)?
// When we search for a pattern in a text using a basic approach, we often end up checking the same characters again after a mismatch. This makes the process slow, especially if the pattern has repeated parts.
// The KMP algorithm avoids this by using a helper array called the LPS (Longest Prefix which is also Suffix) array. It tells us how much of the pattern we can skip when a mismatch happens.
// This helps us search the pattern in the text quickly without going backward in the text or rechecking already matched characters.
// First, create the LPS array. It stores, for each index, the length of the longest prefix of the pattern which is also a suffix.
// Start matching the pattern with the text from left to right.
// If the characters match, move forward in both the pattern and the text.
// If thereâ€™s a mismatch after some matches, use the LPS array to move the pattern pointer to the correct position without going back in the text.
// When the whole pattern matches, store the index and continue searching using LPS.
// Repeat this process until the entire text has been checked.
// Return all the starting positions where the pattern is found in the text.

// Complexity Analysis
// Time Complexity: O(n + m), where n is the length of the text and m is the length of the pattern. This is because both the LPS preprocessing and the pattern searching phases take linear time.
// Space Complexity: O(m), used for storing the LPS array of the pattern.
