// Longest Palindromic Substring

// Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.

// Example 1:
// Input: s = "babad"
// Output: "bab"
// Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.

// Example 2:
// Input: s = "cbbd"
// Output: "bb"

// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length <= 1000
// s consist of only digits and English letters.

// Approach:
// The goal is to find the longest palindromic substring by treating each character (and each pair) as a potential center.
// Every palindrome is symmetric, so we expand outward from a center to check for symmetry.
// There are two types of centers to consider: one at a character (odd-length) and one between characters (even-length).
// For each center, expand left and right while the characters on both sides match.
// Keep track of the maximum length palindrome found by updating its start and end indices.
// The final result is the substring between the recorded boundaries of the longest expansion.

// Space Complexity: O(1) No extra space used.
