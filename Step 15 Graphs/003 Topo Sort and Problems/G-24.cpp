// Course Schedule I and II | Pre-requisite Tasks | Topological Sort: G-24

// Problem Statement I (Course Schedule): There are a total of n tasks you have to pick, labeled from 0 to n-1. Some tasks may have prerequisites tasks, for example, to pick task 0 you have to first finish tasks 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0, 1]
// Given the total number of n tasks and a list of prerequisite pairs of size m. Find the order of tasks you should pick to finish all tasks.
// Note: There may be multiple correct orders, you need to return one of them. If it is impossible to finish all tasks, return an empty array.

// Problem Statement II (Pre-requisite Tasks): There are a total of N tasks, labeled from 0 to N-1. Some tasks may have prerequisites, for example, to do task 0 you have to first complete task 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0, 1]
// Given the total number of tasks N and a list of prerequisite pairs P, find if it is possible to finish all tasks.
// Note: These two questions are linked. The second question asks if it is possible to finish all the tasks and the first question states to return the ordering of the tasks if it is possible to perform all the tasks, otherwise return an empty array.

// The solutions will be similar for both questions as we need to check for one, and in the other, we need to print the order. The questions state that the given pairs signify the dependencies of tasks. For example, the pair {u, v} signifies that to perform task v, first we need to finish task u. Now, if we closely observe, we can think of a directed edge between u and v(u -> v) where u and v are two nodes. Now, if we can think of each task as a node and every pair as a directed edge between those two nodes, the whole problem becomes a graph problem.

// Analyzing the graphs, we can conclude that performing all the tasks from the first set is possible because the first graph does not contain any cycle but as the second graph contains a cycle, performing all the tasks from the second set is impossible(there exists a cyclic dependency between the tasks). So, first, we need to identify a graph as a directed acyclic graph and if it is so we need to find out the linear ordering of the nodes as well(second part for the question: Course schedule).
// Now, we have successfully reduced the problem to one of our known concepts: Detect cycle in a directed graph. We will solve this problem using the Topological Sort Algorithm or Kahnâ€™s Algorithm.
// Topological sorting only exists in Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). If the nodes of a graph are connected through directed edges and the graph does not contain a cycle, it is called a directed acyclic graph(DAG). 
// The topological sorting of a directed acyclic graph is nothing but the linear ordering of vertices such that if there is an edge between node u and v(u -> v), node u appears before v in that ordering.
// For the second problem, we can also apply the algorithm used in the detection of cycles in a directed graph (using DFS) where we used to find out if the graph has a cycle or not. But to solve the first question we have to figure out the linear ordering of the task as well. So, we will use the topological sort algorithm for both questions.

// Intuition:
// For problem I, the intuition is to find the linear ordering in which the tasks will be performed if it is possible to perform all the tasks otherwise, to return an empty array.
// For problem II, the intuition is to find if it is possible to perform all the tasks(i.e. The graph contains a cycle or not).
