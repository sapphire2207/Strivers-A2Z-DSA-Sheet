// Kahn's Algorithm | Topological Sort Algorithm | BFS: G-22

// Problem Statement: Given a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with V vertices and E edges, Find any Topological Sorting of that Graph.
// Note: In topological sorting, node u will always appear before node v if there is a directed edge from node u towards node v(u -> v).

// the intuition is to find the ordering in which the nodes are connected in a directed acyclic graph. For this, we will use a slightly modified version of BFS where we will be requiring a queue data structure(First In First Out data structure) and an array that will store the indegree of each node. The indegree of a node is the number of directed edges incoming towards it.

// Initial Configuration:
// Indegree Array: Initially all elements are set to 0. Then, We will count the incoming edges for a node and store it in this array. For example, if indegree of node 3 is 2, indegree[3] = 2.
// Queue: As we will use BFS, a queue is required. Initially, the node with indegree 0 will be pushed into the queue.
// Answer array: Initially empty and is used to store the linear ordering.
// The algorithm steps are as follows:
// First, we will calculate the indegree of each node and store it in the indegree array. We can iterate through the given adj list, and simply for every node u->v, we can increase the indegree of v by 1 in the indegree array. 
// Initially, there will be always at least a single node whose indegree is 0. So, we will push the node(s) with indegree 0 into the queue.
// Then, we will pop a node from the queue including the node in our answer array, and for all its adjacent nodes, we will decrease the indegree of that node by one. For example, if node u that has been popped out from the queue has an edge towards node v(u->v), we will decrease indegree[v] by 1.
// After that, if for any node the indegree becomes 0, we will push that node again into the queue.
// We will repeat steps 3 and 4 until the queue is completely empty. Finally, completing the BFS we will get the linear ordering of the nodes in the answer array.
// Letâ€™s understand how to find the indegree(s):
// By visiting the adjacency list, we can find out the indegrees for each node. For example, if node 3 is an adjacent node of node 2, we will just increase indegree[3] by 1 as the adjacency list suggests that node 3 has an incoming edge from node 2.
// Note: If you wish to see the dry run of the above approach, you can watch the video attached to this article.

// Output: 4 5 0 2 3 1
// Time Complexity: O(V+E), where V = no. of nodes and E = no. of edges. This is a simple BFS algorithm.
// Space Complexity: O(N) + O(N) ~ O(2N), O(N) for the indegree array, and O(N) for the queue data structure used in BFS(where N = no.of nodes).
