// Distance of Nearest Cell having 1

// Problem Statement: Given a binary grid of N*M. Find the distance of the nearest 1 in the grid for each cell.
// The distance is calculated as |i1  - i2| + |j1 - j2|, where i1, j1 are the row number and column number of the current cell, and i2, j2 are the row number and column number of the nearest cell having value 1.

// Breadth First Search, BFS, is a traversal technique where we visit the nodes level-wise, i.e., it visits the same level nodes simultaneously, and then moves to the next level. 
// The intuition is that BFS will take a step from cells containing 1 and will reach out to all zeros that are at a distance of one. Apparently, we can say that the nearest 1 to the 0s is at a distance of one. Again if we take another step, we will reach the next set of zeros, for these zeros 1 is at a distance of two. If we continue the same, till we can go, we can reach all the 0’s possible. 
// We will choose the BFS algorithm as it moves step by step and we want all of them to traverse in a single step together so that we can have a minimum count with us.

// Time Complexity: O(NxM + NxMx4) ~ O(N x M)
// For the worst case, the BFS function will be called for (N x M) nodes, and for every node, we are traversing for 4 neighbors, so it will take O(N x M x 4) time.
// Space Complexity: O(N x M) + O(N x M) + O(N x M) ~ O(N x M)
// O(N x M) for the visited array, distance matrix, and queue space takes up N x M locations at max.
