// Shortest Path in Directed Acyclic Graph Topological Sort: G-27

// Given a DAG, find the shortest path from the source to all other nodes in this DAG. In this problem statement, we have assumed the source vertex to be ‘0’. You will be given the weighted edges of the graph.
// Note: What is a DAG ( Directed Acyclic Graph)?
// A Directed Graph (containing one-sided edges) having no cycles is said to be a Directed Acyclic Graph.

// Intuition:
// Finding the shortest path to a vertex is easy if you already know the shortest paths to all the vertices that can precede it. Processing the vertices in topological order ensures that by the time you get to a vertex, you've already processed all the vertices that can precede it which reduces the computation time significantly. In this approach, we traverse the nodes sequentially according to their reachability from the source.
// Dijkstra's algorithm is necessary for graphs that can contain cycles because they can't be topologically sorted. In other cases, the topological sort would work fine as we start from the first node, and then move on to the others in a directed manner.

// Approach:
// We will calculate the shortest path in a directed acyclic graph by using topological sort. Topological sort can be implemented in two ways- BFS and DFS. Here, we will be implementing using the DFS technique. Depth First Search, DFS is a traversal technique where we visit a node and then continue visiting its adjacent nodes until we reach the end point, i.e., it keeps on moving in the depth of a particular node and then backtracks when no further adjacent nodes are available.
