// Longest Palindromic Subsequence | (DP-28)

// Problem Statement: Longest Palindromic Subsequence
// A palindromic string is a string that is equal to its reverse. For example: “Nitin” is a palindromic string. Now the question states to find the length of the longest palindromic subsequence of a string. It is that palindromic subsequence of the given string with the greatest length. We need to print the length of the longest palindromic subsequence.

// Tabulation Approach
// We are given a string S, the simplest approach will be to generate all the subsequences and store them, then manually find out the longest palindromic subsequence.
// This naive approach will give us the correct answer but to generate all the subsequences, we will require exponential ( 2n ) time. Therefore we will try some other approaches.
// Using Dynamic Programming
// We can use the approach discussed in the article Longest Common Subsequence, to find the Longest Palindromic Subsequence.

// Intuition:
// Let us say that we are given the following string.
// The longest palindromic subsequence will be: “babcbab”.
// What is special about this string is that it is palindromic (equal to its reverse) and of the longest length.
// Now let us write the reverse of str next to it and please think about the highlighted characters.
// If we look closely at the highlighted characters, they are nothing but the longest common subsequence of the two strings.
// Now, we have taken the reverse of the string for the following two reasons:
// The longest palindromic subsequence being a palindrome will remain the same when the entire string is reversed.
// The length of the palindromic subsequence will also remain the same when the entire string is reversed.
// From the above discussion we can conclude:
// The longest palindromic subsequence of a string is the longest common subsequence of the given string and its reverse.

// Approach:
// The algorithm is stated as follows:
// We are given a string (say s), make a copy of it and store it( say string t).
// Reverse the original string s.
// Find the longest common subsequence as discussed in dp-25.

    // Create a 2D DP array to store the length of the LCS
    vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(m + 1, -1));

    // Initialize the first row and first column to 0
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i][0] = 0;

// Output: The Length of Longest Palindromic Subsequence is 7
// Complexity Analysis
// Time Complexity: O(N*N)
// Reason: There are two nested loops
// Space Complexity: O(N*N)
// Reason: We are using an external array of size ‘(N*N)’. Stack Space is eliminated.

// Space Optimization Approach
// If we closely we are using two rows: dp[ind1-1][ ], dp[ind][ ],
// So we are not required to contain an entire array, we can simply have two rows prev and cur where prev corresponds to dp[ind-1] and cur to dp[ind].
// After declaring prev and cur, replace dp[ind-1] to prev and dp[ind] with cur and after the inner loop executes, we will set prev = cur, so that the cur row can serve as prev for the next index.
