// Dynamic Programming: Frog Jump with k Distances (DP 4)

// In this article, we will learn about "Dynamic Programming: Frog Jump with k Distances (DP 4)"
// Problem Statement:  Frog Jump with K Distance/ Learn to write 1D DP
// This is a follow-up question to “Frog Jump” discussed in the previous article. In the previous question, the frog was allowed to jump either one or two steps at a time. In this question, the frog is allowed to jump up to ‘K’ steps at a time. If K=4, the frog can jump 1,2,3, or 4 steps at every index.

// Memorization Approach
// We will first see the modifications required in the pseudo-code. Once the recursive code is formed, we can go ahead with the memorization and tabulation.
// Here is the pseudocode from the simple Frog Jump problem.
// This was the case where we needed to try two options (move a single step and move two steps) in order to try out all the possible ways for the problem. Now, we need to try K options in order to try out all possible ways.
// These are the calls we need to make for K=2, K=3, K=4
// If we generalize, we are making K calls, therefore, we can set a for loop to run from 1 to K, and in each iteration, we can make a function call, corresponding to a step. We will return the minimum step call after the loop.

// The final pseudo-code will be:
// Note: We need to make sure that we are not passing negative index to the array, therefore an extra if the condition is used.
// Once we form the recursive solution, we can use the approach told in Dynamic Programming Introduction to convert it into a dynamic programming one.

// Memoization approach
// Steps to convert Recursive code to memoization solution:
// Create a dp[n] array initialized to -1.
// Whenever we want to find the answer of a particular value (say n), we first check whether the answer is already calculated using the dp array(i.e dp[n] != -1 ). If yes, simply return the value from the dp array.
// If not, then we are finding the answer for the given value for the first time, we will use the recursive relation as usual but before returning from the function, we will set dp[n] to the solution we get.
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Function to find the minimum cost to reach the end using at most 'k' jumps
int solveUtil(int ind, vector<int>& height, vector<int>& dp, int k) {
    // Base case: If we are at the beginning (index 0), no cost is needed.
    if (ind == 0) return 0;
    
    // If the result for this index has been previously calculated, return it.
    if (dp[ind] != -1) return dp[ind];
    
    int mmSteps = INT_MAX;
    
    // Loop to try all possible jumps from '1' to 'k'
    for (int j = 1; j <= k; j++) {
        // Ensure that we do not jump beyond the beginning of the array
        if (ind - j >= 0) {
            // Calculate the cost for this jump and update mmSteps with the minimum cost
            int jump = solveUtil(ind - j, height, dp, k) + abs(height[ind] - height[ind - j]);
            mmSteps = min(jump, mmSteps);
        }
    }
    
    // Store the minimum cost for this index in the dp array and return it.
    return dp[ind] = mmSteps;
}

// Function to find the minimum cost to reach the end of the array
int solve(int n, vector<int>& height, int k) {
    vector<int> dp(n, -1); // Initialize a memoization array to store calculated results
    return solveUtil(n - 1, height, dp, k); // Start the recursion from the last index
}

int main() {
    vector<int> height{30, 10, 60, 10, 60, 50};
    int n = height.size();
    int k = 2;
    vector<int> dp(n, -1); // Initialize a memoization array for the main function
    cout << solve(n, height, k) << endl; // Print the result of the solve function
    return 0;
}

// Output: 40
// Complexity Analysis
// Time Complexity: O(N *K)
// Reason: The overlapping subproblems will return the answer in constant time. Therefore the total number of new subproblems we solve is ‘n’. At every new subproblem, we are running another loop for K times. Hence total time complexity is O(N * K).
// Space Complexity: O(N)
// Reason: We are using a recursion stack space(O(N)) and an array (again O(N)). Therefore total space complexity will be O(N) + O(N) ≈ O(N)

// Tabulation Approach
// Declare a dp[] array of size n.
// First initialize the base condition values, i.e dp[0] as 0.
// Set an iterative loop which traverses the array( from index 1 to n-1) and for every index calculate jumpOne and jumpTwo and set dp[i] = min(jumpOne, jumpTwo).

using namespace std;

// Function to find the minimum cost to reach the end using at most 'k' jumps
int solveUtil(int n, vector<int>& height, vector<int>& dp, int k) {
    dp[0] = 0;

    // Loop through the array to fill in the dp array
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        int mmSteps = INT_MAX;

        // Loop to try all possible jumps from '1' to 'k'
        for (int j = 1; j <= k; j++) {
            if (i - j >= 0) {
                int jump = dp[i - j] + abs(height[i] - height[i - j]);
                mmSteps = min(jump, mmSteps);
            }
        }
        dp[i] = mmSteps;
    }
    return dp[n - 1]; // The result is stored in the last element of dp
}

// Function to find the minimum cost to reach the end of the array
int solve(int n, vector<int>& height, int k) {
    vector<int> dp(n, -1); // Initialize a memoization array to store calculated results
    return solveUtil(n, height, dp, k);
}

int main() {
    vector<int> height{30, 10, 60, 10, 60, 50};
    int n = height.size();
    int k = 2;
    vector<int> dp(n, -1); // Initialize a memoization array for the main function
    cout << solve(n, height, k) << endl; // Print the result of the solve function
    return 0;
}

// Output: 40
// Complexity Analysis
// Time Complexity: O(N*K)
// Reason: We are running two nested loops, where outer loops run from 1 to n-1 and the inner loop runs from 1 to K
// Space Complexity: O(N)
// Reason: We are using an external array of size ‘n’’.
