// Problem 5:-
//  Youâ€™re given an sorted array arr of n integers and an integer x. Find the floor and ceiling of x in arr[0..n-1].
// The floor of x is the largest element in the array which is smaller than or equal to x. arr[index]<=x
// The ceiling of x is the smallest element in the array greater than or equal to x. ==> arr[index]>=x

// Input Format: n = 6, arr[] ={3, 4, 4, 7, 8, 10}, x= 5
// Result: 4 7
// Explanation: The floor of 5 in the array is 4, and the ceiling of 5 in the array is 7.

// Here again ceiling is nothing but finding a lower bound

// Floor Calculation:-
// We go with same previous approach
// If arr[mid] <= x: arr[mid] is a possible answer. So, we will store it and will try to find a larger number that satisfies the same condition. That is why we will remove the left half and try to find the number in the right half.
// If arr[mid] > x: The arr[mid] is definitely not the answer and we need a smaller number. So, we will reduce the search space to the left half by removing the right half.
// TC:- O(logN)
