// Count inversions in an array

// Problem Statement: Given an array of N integers, count the inversion of the array (using merge-sort).
// What is an inversion of an array? Definition: for all i & j < size of array, if i < j then you have to find pair (A[i],A[j]) such that A[j] < A[i].

// Example 1:
// Input Format: N = 5, array[] = {1,2,3,4,5}
// Result: 0
// Explanation: we have a sorted array and the sorted array has 0 inversions as for i < j you will never find a pair such that A[j] < A[i]. More clear example: 2 has index 1 and 5 has index 4 now 1 < 5 but 2 < 5 so this is not an inversion.

// Brute Force Approach
// The naive approach is pretty straightforward. We will use nested loops to solve this problem. We know index i must be smaller than index j. So, we will fix i at one index at a time through a loop, and with another loop, we will check(the condition a[i] > a[j]) the elements from index i+1 to N-1  if they can form a pair with a[i]. This is the first naive approach we can think of.
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int numberOfInversions(vector<int>&a, int n) {

    // Count the number of pairs:
    int cnt = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            if (a[i] > a[j]) cnt++;
        }
    }
    return cnt;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> a = {5, 4, 3, 2, 1};
    int n = 5;
    int cnt = numberOfInversions(a, n);
    cout << "The number of inversions is: "
         << cnt << endl;
    return 0;
}

// Output: The number of inversions is: 10

// Time Complexity: O(N2), where N = size of the given array.
// Reason: We are using nested loops here and those two loops roughly run for N times.
// Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space to solve this problem.

// Optimal Approach
// Letâ€™s build the intuition for this approach using a modified version of the given question.
// Assume two sorted arrays are given i.e. a1[] = {2, 3, 5, 6} and a2[] = {2, 2, 4, 4, 8}. Now, we have to count the pairs i.e. a1[i] and a2[j] such that a1[i] > a2[j].
// In order to solve this, we will keep two pointers i and j, where i will point to the first index of a1[] and j will point to the first index of a2[]. Now in each iteration, we will do the following:
// If a1[i] <= a2[j]: These two elements cannot be a pair and so we will move the pointer i to the next position. This case is illustrated below:
// Why we moved the i pointer: We know, that the given arrays are sorted. So, all the elements after the pointer j, should be greater than a2[j]. Now, as a1[i] is smaller or equal to a2[j], it is obvious that a1[i] will be smaller or equal to all the elements after a2[j]. We need a bigger value of a1[i] to make a pair and so we move the i pointer to the next position i.e. next bigger value.
// If a1[i] > a2[j]: These two elements can be a pair and so we will update the count of pairs. Now, here, we should observe that as a1[i] is greater than a2[j], all the elements after a1[i] will also be greater than a2[j] and so, those elements will also make pair with a2[j]. So, the number of pairs added will be n1-i (where n1 = size of a1[ ]). Now, we will move the j pointer to the next position. This case is also illustrated below:

// The above process will continue until at least one of the pointers reaches the end.
// Until now, we have figured out how to count the number of pairs in one go if two sorted arrays are given. But in our actual question, only a single unsorted array is given. So, how to break it into two sorted halves so that we can apply the above observation? 
// We can think of the merge sort algorithm that works in a similar way we want. In the merge sort algorithm, at every step, we divide the given array into two halves and then sort them, and while doing that we can actually count the number of pairs.
// Basically, we will use the merge sort algorithm to use the observation in the correct way
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int merge(vector<int> &arr, int low, int mid, int high) {
    vector<int> temp; // temporary array
    int left = low;      // starting index of left half of arr
    int right = mid + 1;   // starting index of right half of arr

    //Modification 1: cnt variable to count the pairs:
    int cnt = 0;

    //storing elements in the temporary array in a sorted manner//

    while (left <= mid && right <= high) {
        if (arr[left] <= arr[right]) {
            temp.push_back(arr[left]);
            left++;
        }
        else {
            temp.push_back(arr[right]);
            cnt += (mid - left + 1); //Modification 2
            right++;
        }
    }

    // if elements on the left half are still left //

    while (left <= mid) {
        temp.push_back(arr[left]);
        left++;
    }

    //  if elements on the right half are still left //
    while (right <= high) {
        temp.push_back(arr[right]);
        right++;
    }

    // transfering all elements from temporary to arr //
    for (int i = low; i <= high; i++) {
        arr[i] = temp[i - low];
    }

    return cnt; // Modification 3
}

int mergeSort(vector<int> &arr, int low, int high) {
    int cnt = 0;
    if (low >= high) return cnt;
    int mid = (low + high) / 2 ;
    cnt += mergeSort(arr, low, mid);  // left half
    cnt += mergeSort(arr, mid + 1, high); // right half
    cnt += merge(arr, low, mid, high);  // merging sorted halves
    return cnt;
}

int numberOfInversions(vector<int>&a, int n) {

    // Count the number of pairs:
    return mergeSort(a, 0, n - 1);
}

int main() {
    vector<int> a = {5, 4, 3, 2, 1};
    int n = 5;
    int cnt = numberOfInversions(a, n);
    cout << "The number of inversions are: "
         << cnt << endl;
    return 0;
}


// Output: The number of inversions is: 10

// Time Complexity: O(N*logN), where N = size of the given array.
// Reason: We are not changing the merge sort algorithm except by adding a variable to it. So, the time complexity is as same as the merge sort.
// Space Complexity: O(N), as in the merge sort We use a temporary array to store elements in sorted order.
